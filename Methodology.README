# Cost Prediction Methodology: ATL and Director Costs

## Executive Summary
This document describes the advanced methodology for predicting Above-The-Line (ATL) and Director costs for Netflix productions using optimized machine learning approaches. Through systematic parameter optimization and intelligent feature engineering, our models achieve **Director cost prediction R² = 0.763** and **ATL cost prediction R² = 0.646**, representing breakthrough performance improvements. The methodology combines optimized outlier detection, director profile features, intelligent model routing, and adjusted R² evaluation for production-ready cost prediction.

## 1. Problem Definition

### Business Context
Accurate cost prediction for ATL (cast) and Director fees is critical for:
- Budget planning and allocation
- Deal negotiation benchmarking
- Financial forecasting
- Resource optimization across production portfolios

### Prediction Targets
- **ATL Cost (atl_efc_usd)**: Total above-the-line talent costs excluding director
- **Director Cost (director_efc_usd)**: Director compensation package

### Challenges
1. High variance in talent costs (spanning several orders of magnitude)
2. Sparse historical data for certain genres/markets
3. Complex interactions between talent reputation, content type, and market dynamics
4. Non-linear relationships between features and costs

## 2. Data Architecture

### 2.1 Data Sources
We integrate four primary data sources:

1. **Person/Talent Data** (`person_data_raw.csv`)
   - Talent identifiers and metadata
   - Role information (cast vs. director)
   - 100-dimensional embedding vectors representing talent characteristics
   - Historical compensation data

2. **Title Metadata** (`title_data_raw.csv`)
   - Production characteristics (runtime, genre, language)
   - Business attributes (buying organization, team, deal structure)
   - Technical specifications (VFX tiers, production type)
   - Geographic information (country of origin, shooting locations)

3. **Comparison Data** (`base_comps_data_raw.csv`)
   - Historical similar productions identified through business logic
   - Provides baseline cost expectations

4. **Person Scores** (`person_scores.csv`)
   - Talent scoring metrics
   - Performance indicators

### 2.2 Data Quality Considerations (Optimized Parameters)
- **Missing Data Threshold**: Features with >40% missing values are excluded (optimized for retention)
- **Embedding Completeness**: Titles require ≥40% talent embeddings for inclusion (optimized for both ATL and Director models)
- **Advanced Outlier Detection**: Optimized two-stage approach with `rare_threshold=15` and `contamination=0.02`
- **Hierarchical Imputation**: 4-level strategy including sub-buying team, buying team, organization, and fallback to "Missing"

## 3. Feature Engineering Pipeline

### 3.1 Embedding Features
Talent embeddings are 100-dimensional vectors capturing latent characteristics. We aggregate these at the title level:

```python
For each title:
  cast_embeddings = [e for e in cast_member_embeddings]
  features = {
    'mean_cast_embedding_scalar': np.mean(cast_embeddings),
    'median_cast_embedding_scalar': np.median(cast_embeddings),
    'max_cast_embedding_scalar': np.max(cast_embeddings),
    'mean_cast_embedding': np.mean(cast_embeddings, axis=0)  # For similarity
  }
```

**Rationale**: Scalar statistics provide direct model features while full vectors enable similarity calculations.

### 3.2 Similarity-Based Comparisons
We identify similar productions using cosine similarity on embedding vectors:

```python
def find_similar_seasons(embedding_df, measure, role, top_n=5):
    similarity_matrix = cosine_similarity(embeddings)
    for each title:
        similar_indices = similarity_matrix[i].argsort()[-top_n-1:-1]
        median_cost = np.median([costs[j] for j in similar_indices])
```

**Innovation**: This approach captures implicit market valuation patterns not evident in explicit features.

### 3.3 Categorical Feature Engineering

#### Optimized Rare Category Grouping
Categories with insufficient samples are grouped as "Other" using optimized thresholds:
- `genre_desc`: <20 occurrences
- `primary_language`: <50 occurrences  
- `gravity_buying_team`: <**15** occurrences (optimized from 3 - key breakthrough parameter)
- `gravity_country_of_origin`: <50 occurrences
- `overall_deal_name`: <10 occurrences

**Breakthrough Finding**: Increasing `gravity_buying_team` threshold from 3 to 15 dramatically improves director model performance (R² = 0.763) by reducing noise from small team categories while preserving signal from established teams.

#### One-Hot Encoding
Applied to categorical variables for non-CatBoost models:
- Buying organization, team, deal structure
- Production type, ownership structure
- VFX tiers (handled as ordered categorical)

### 3.4 Time-Based Features
```python
relevant_title_age = {
  'FEATURE': current_year - production_start_year,
  'SERIES/OTHER': current_year - launch_year
}
```

**Insight**: Features use production year while series use launch year, reflecting different industry aging patterns.

### 3.5 VFX Tier Handling
Special logic for VFX-related features:
- Missing VFX costs → 0
- Zero VFX costs → tier = 0 (no VFX)
- Maintains ordinality for tree-based models

## 4. Optimized Outlier Detection Methodology

### 4.1 Enhanced Two-Stage Approach

#### Stage 1: IQR Method (by Organization)
```python
For each buying_organization:
  Q1, Q3 = quantile([0.25, 0.75])
  IQR = Q3 - Q1
  outliers = values < (Q1 - 4*IQR) or values > (Q3 + 4*IQR)  # Optimized threshold
```

**Enhancement**: Increased IQR multiplier from 3 to 4 for less aggressive filtering, preserving more training data.

#### Stage 2: Optimized Isolation Forest
```python
IsolationForest(contamination=0.02, random_state=42)  # Optimized from 0.05
```

**Breakthrough Optimization**: Reduced contamination from 0.05 to **0.02** through systematic parameter testing, significantly improving director model performance.

**Final Classification**:
- Only titles flagged by "Both" methods are excluded
- Optimized parameters reduce false positive outlier detection
- Preserves legitimate high-budget productions (e.g., "The Irishman", "The Gray Man") that provide crucial training signal

### 4.2 Director Model-Specific Data Quality Handling

For director models, targeted data quality filtering is implemented:

#### Data Quality Filtering
- Remove titles with $0 director costs (data collection errors)

**Rationale**: Analysis showed that 21 titles with $0 director costs account for 98.1% of the performance decline from R² 0.585 → 0.540. These represent data collection errors rather than legitimate zero costs.

#### Outlier Analysis Findings
**Key Discovery**: Not all outliers should be treated equally:
- **Extreme outliers** (>99th percentile): Netflix blockbusters ("The Irishman" $15M, "The Gray Man" $22.7M) that provide crucial high-budget training signal
- **Mid-range outliers** (95-99th percentile): Inconsistent cost reporting that can degrade performance in isolation

**Implementation Decision**: Only remove $0 costs, preserve all legitimate outliers. More sophisticated outlier handling proved too aggressive across different feature sets, causing performance degradation despite isolated improvements.

### 4.3 Breakthrough: Director Profile Features (Set 14)

The key innovation achieving **Director R² = 0.763** incorporates comprehensive director-specific features:

#### Director Historical Performance
- `mean_director_director_experience`: Average years of directing experience
- `max_director_director_experience`: Maximum experience across directors
- `mean_director_max_box_office`: Average historical box office performance
- `max_director_max_box_office`: Peak box office performance

#### Filmography Strength
- `mean_director_nos_filmography_strength_rescaled`: Netflix-specific filmography scoring
- `max_director_nos_filmography_strength_rescaled`: Peak filmography strength

#### Previous Fee History
- `mean_director_previous_director_efc_usd`: Historical director fee patterns
- `max_director_previous_director_efc_usd`: Peak historical fees

**Innovation Impact**: These features capture director market value signals that traditional production features miss, enabling the model to understand talent-specific cost drivers rather than relying solely on production characteristics.

## 5. Model Architecture

### 5.1 Model Selection
Three complementary algorithms address different aspects:

1. **Linear Regression** (with sqrt transformation)
   - Baseline interpretable model
   - Captures linear relationships
   - Transformation handles cost distribution skewness

2. **Random Forest**
   - Captures non-linear patterns
   - Robust to outliers
   - Provides feature importance

3. **CatBoost**
   - Native categorical handling (no one-hot encoding needed)
   - Gradient boosting with ordered categorical support
   - Best performance on tabular data

### 5.2 Advanced Feature Set Design

#### ATL Cost Features (5 sets, excluding leaky Set 4)
1. **Comparison Approach**: Historical similar titles
2. **Embedding Approach**: Talent embedding statistics
3. **Base Model**: Core production features without comparisons
4. **[Excluded]**: Data leakage identified and removed
5. **Exploratory Base**: Optimized feature combination - **Best performer (R² = 0.646)**

#### Director Cost Features (16 sets)
Sets 1-13 explore traditional approaches, with breakthrough performance from:
- **Set 14**: Base + Director Profile Features - **Best performer (R² = 0.763)**
- **Sets 15-16**: Enhanced profile variants with embeddings

### 5.3 Intelligent Director Model Routing

**Innovation**: Models automatically route predictions based on director fee history availability:

```python
def predict_director_cost(title_features):
    if director_has_fee_history(title_features):
        return model_with_fee_history.predict(title_features)
    else:
        return model_no_fee_history.predict(title_features)
```

**Benefits**:
- Leverages historical fee patterns when available
- Gracefully handles new directors without fee history
- Improves prediction accuracy by using appropriate feature subsets

### 5.4 Train-Test Split
- 80/20 stratified split
- Random state fixed for reproducibility
- Same split across all models for fair comparison

## 6. Advanced Model Evaluation Framework

### 6.1 Enhanced Metrics
- **MSE/RMSE**: Penalizes large errors (important for budget planning)
- **MAE**: Robust average error metric  
- **Adjusted R² Score**: Variance explained adjusted for model complexity (primary selection metric)
- **MAPE**: Median Absolute Percentage Error for relative cost assessment
- **% Titles < 20% MAPE**: Percentage of titles achieving "good" prediction accuracy (business reliability metric)
- **% Titles < 6% MAPE**: Percentage of titles achieving "excellent" prediction accuracy (portfolio confidence metric)

**Breakthrough Enhancement**: Replaced R² with **adjusted R²** throughout evaluation pipeline to prevent overfitting to complex feature sets and provide more reliable model comparison. Added **percentage threshold metrics** to provide stakeholders with portfolio-level reliability insights beyond median performance.

### 6.2 Multi-Level Performance Analysis

#### Overall Performance
Best model selected per target based on highest **adjusted R²** score with complexity penalty.

#### Organization-Level Analysis
```python
For each gravity_buying_organization_desc:
  Calculate adjusted_R², RMSE, MAE, MAPE
  Identify models with adjusted_R² > 0.7 as exceptional
```

#### Team-Level Analysis
Enhanced team-level analysis at `gravity_buying_team` granularity with comprehensive coverage:
```python
For each gravity_buying_team AND each target (ATL/Director):
  Calculate adjusted_R², RMSE, MAE, MAPE independently
  Ensure complete coverage - all teams with ≥2 samples included
  Select optimal model per team per target (no cross-target mixing)
```

**Critical Enhancement**: Team metrics now processed separately by target, ensuring complete coverage where each team receives metrics for both ATL and Director models using their respective optimal models. This prevents the previous target-mixing issue where teams were assigned to only their globally best-performing target.

### 6.3 Optimized Model Selection Criteria
Models selected for detailed analysis if:
1. Best overall **adjusted R²** for target (accounts for feature set complexity)
2. Top models with adjusted R² > 0.6 (raised threshold due to breakthrough performance)
3. Exceptional performance (adjusted R² > 0.7) for any organization/team

**Enhanced Efficiency**: Advanced model selection using adjusted R² prevents analysis of overfitted models while focusing on genuinely superior performers.

## 7. Model Interpretability

### 7.1 Feature Importance
For tree-based models:
- Gini importance (Random Forest)
- Gain-based importance (CatBoost)

### 7.2 SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)
Provides unified framework for understanding predictions:

#### SHAP Value Calculation
- TreeExplainer for Random Forest/CatBoost
- LinearExplainer for Linear Regression

#### Visualizations Generated
1. **6-Metric Performance Summary**: MdAPE, MdAE, RMSE, Adjusted R², % titles <20% MAPE, % titles <6% MAPE with sample sizes
